# WorkTrace

The next-generation development system of version control, task management, and network collaboration. This project is designed for multiple types of working outputs in mind, not just for coding.

- ⚠️ This project is still under frequent development, and had not been prepared for the community. Even the license is unsure yet. Please at least wait for the first release.
- 📓 This repository is refactored on an [earlier archived version](https://github.com/worktrace/early-backup).
